# SM-SERVER  -- *temp*

[Development Board](https://github.com/amazingefren/sm-server/projects/1)

Development will be slower as I am currently working on another project
You might see secretkeys, note that it is okay and they are not real keys :) or maybe they are

Disclaimer: This is NOT at all a production ready project, I am adding things by impulse BUT I will probably add proper tests / logging and more in the future

Will be moved to a monorepo

Currently super early development, expect drastic changes

Will have
* Subscriptions / Websockets
* Authentication
* GraphQL w/ Apollo
* WebRTC
* ... and more? (TBA)
